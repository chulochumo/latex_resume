  new transport protocol originally designed to transfer SS7 signaling
  messages over packet switched networks but that has been standarized
  as a general transport protocol. This thesis focuses on its
  retransmission mechanisms and the peculiar effects that certain
  network conditions have on them providing insight into optimization
  opportunities.}

\section{Experience}

\cventry{Jan 2012 - Present}{Research Assistant}{Thesis}{Texas State
  University}{}{Spearheaded research on a relatively new transport
  protocol (SCTP).
\begin{itemize}
\item Performed a extensive literature review on current SCTP
  research.
\item Designed and developed testing environment running on Linux that
  automated Kernel Module compilation, loading/unloading and logged
  relevant SCTP transfer parameters.
\item Performed in-depth analysis of SCTP retransmission parameters
  including: Return Time Out, Round Trip Time and Return Time Out
  Minimum.
\item Performed in-depth analysis of the effect of network parameters
  on SCTP performance including: Packet Loss, Packet Spacing and
  Packet Delay.
\item Evaluated a proposed adaptive algorithm for managing the Return
  Time Out Minimum SCTP parameter.
\item Discovered bug in SCTP Linux Kernel Module and submitted fix to
  developers mailing list.
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{Jul - Sep 2012}{GNURadio Module for Custom SDR
  Platform}{Freelance Project}{Austin, TX}{}{Developed a GNURadio
  module to control, receive and display samples from a custom high
  bandwidth radio receiver.
\begin{itemize}
\item Created C Library that used TCP sockets to send and receive
  custom control structures from SDR hardware and used UDP sockets to
  receive raw IQ samples from SDR hardware in VITA49 format over
  10GbE.
\item Created Python wrappings for C library using SWIG.
\item Created graphical block for GNURadio Companion using XML.
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{Aug - Dec 2011}{Vibration Sensor System}{Freelance
  Project}{Austin, TX}{}{Created a small embedded system that used an
  accelerometer to measure large vibrations.}

\cventry{Jun - Aug  2011}{Speech Detector}{Flex-Radio Systems}{Round
  Rock, TX}{}{Created non-computationally intensive speech detector
  for existing Software Designed Radio System based on Motorola's
  MICOM circuit \cite{VOXPaper}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Received and analyzed schematic for an analog speech detection
  system developed in the 70s for HAM Radio operators.
\item Modeled analog circuit using Multisim with a speech audio file
  as input.
\item Created a digital model of the analog speech detector using
  Simulink.
\item Conducted a literature review to find applicable approaches for
  speech detection in audio.
\item Combined features from the analog circuit and digital approaches
to create a robust speech detection system that maintained very low
computation overhead.
\end{itemize}}%
